# Intelligent Modular Panel (IMP)

This project demonstrates a modular system for generating user interfaces for IoT devices based on their capabilities and a high-level prompt.

## Architecture

The project is composed of three main components:

1.  **UI Generator**: A server that receives a prompt, a Thing Description (a standardized way to describe an IoT device), and a set of capabilities, and it generates a UI definition for the device.
2.  **External Thing**: A server that simulates an IoT device (in this case, a light switch). It exposes a Thing Description and an API to interact with the device.
3.  **End Devices**: Web applications that display the UI generated by the UI Generator and interact with the External Thing.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Install the dependencies for each package. Open a terminal and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    # For the UI Generator
    cd packages/ui-generator
    npm install

    # For the External Thing
    cd ../external-thing
    npm install

    # For the End Device
    cd ../end-device
    npm install

    # For the Passive End Device
    cd ../passive-end-device
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Project

To run the project, you need to start all three components in separate terminals.

1.  **Start the UI Generator**:

    ```bash
    cd packages/ui-generator
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the UI Generator server on port 3001.

2.  **Start the External Thing**:

    ```bash
    cd packages/external-thing
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the External Thing server on port 3002.

3.  **Start the End Devices**:

    You can run either the standard `end-device` or the `passive-end-device`.

    *   To run the **standard End Device**:

        ```bash
        cd packages/end-device
        npm run dev
        ```

    *   To run the **Passive End Device**:

        ```bash
        cd packages/passive-end-device
        npm run dev
        ```

    The end device application will be available at the address shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173` or a similar port).
